            You can clear this data at any time through your browser's developer tools or by clearing site data for

            GanttSmart loads the Inter typeface from{' '}
            <ExternalLink href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">fonts.googleapis.com</ExternalLink>. This causes your
            browser to make a direct request to Google's servers, which may log your IP address and user-agent string.
            We do not control this logging. If this is a concern, you can use a browser extension to block Google Fonts
            requests — the application will fall back to your system font.

        <Section title="5. Shareable Roadmap Links">
          <p>
            When you create a shareable roadmap link, GanttSmart stores a snapshot of the selected Gantt data (issues,
            dates, assignees, statuses) in our database to serve the shared view to external viewers without requiring a
            Linear account.
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2 list-none">
            <Li>Snapshots are scoped to the issues and projects you selected at the time of sharing.</Li>
            <Li>
              Password-protected links store only a cryptographic hash of the password — the plaintext password is never
              retained.
            </Li>
            <Li>
              You can delete any share link at any time from the Share dialog in the application. Deletion permanently
              removes the associated snapshot from our servers.
            </Li>
            <Li>
              Share links do not expose your Linear credentials or any data beyond what you explicitly chose to share.

            We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your data from unauthorised access,
